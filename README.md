Artemis Financial was a financial services company that needed help identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in its software, particularly issues related to outdated dependencies and insecure data handling. I approached the assessment thoroughly by combining automated scanning with manual review, which helped me understand each vulnerability and why secure coding is essential for protecting sensitive data, maintaining customer trust, and preventing costly breaches. One of the most challenging yet helpful parts of the process was analyzing scanner results to distinguish true risks from false positives. To increase the system’s security layers, I updated vulnerable libraries, strengthened encryption, improved input validation, and applied secure configuration practices. I ensured the application remained functional and secure by performing regression testing and re‑running vulnerability scans after refactoring to confirm that no new issues were introduced. Throughout the project, I relied on tools like static analysis scanners, dependency‑checkers, and OWASP guidelines—practices that will be useful in future work. For employers, I could showcase my vulnerability assessment report, secure code improvements, and documentation of the testing process as examples of my ability to identify risks, implement fixes, and validate application security.
